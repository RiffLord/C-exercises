# c-exercises
This repository contains only source code for various exercises written in C. To run any of it, either download and import 
into your IDE of choice, build & run, or navigate to the directory from a command line and (provided your C compiler is visible 
to the PATH Environment Variable) type "gcc filename.c -o output-filename" and run the executable.
